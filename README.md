# Data Visualization Project - From Emissions to Emergencies

## Dashboard Context:
With this project, we want to understand how pollution affects the world's largest country polluters, by looking at some of their main polluting emissions output and observe its correlation with Natural Disasters in the last three decades.

Our main focus are the Natural Disasters, more specifically Climatological, Meteorological, Hydrological and Geophysical Disasters collected by the United Nations Statistics Division. This data contains the number of Occurrences, Total Deaths and Persons Affected in each decade of all the four types of disasters combined.

Using the Emissions dataset, we chose to show specific types of polluting emissions, namely CO2, Industry, Agriculture, Waste and Transport.

**How to interact with the dashboard?** You can navigate this dashboard by hovering over the desired fields of interest. For a more detailed analysis, there are multiple filters to select from. You can select a specific Country by clicking on the Emissions Bubble Chart, and you can also filter by Emission Type and Decade.

*All this information can be found by hovering the information icon in the top right corner of  the dashboard.*
